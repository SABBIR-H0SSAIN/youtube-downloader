- **Video Download:** Download YouTube videos in multiple formats.
- **Audio Extraction:** Extract and download audio from YouTube videos.

## ‚ùì Why Express.js Backend Instead of Next.js API Routes?

Express.js is used because it can handle advanced Node.js features like running child processes and efficient streaming, which are required for downloading and processing YouTube content. Next.js API routes have limitations with these operations, making Express.js a better fit for backend tasks in this project.
